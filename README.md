Razor Page Tutorial
I really enjoyed doing this tutorial. It was great to get some insight and examples on how razor pages differ from
MVC. I thought it was cool seeing how things work with out a controller. I did have some trouble just because there is some syntax difference
between Net Core 2.2 and 3.0. But I ended up getting it figured out.
